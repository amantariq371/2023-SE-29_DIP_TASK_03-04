Histogram Equalization and Intensity Transformations (Task 03-04)

This Python program performs contrast enhancement and intensity transformations on a user-uploaded image. It demonstrates histogram equalization using both built-in OpenCV functions (applied to the Y channel in YCrCb color space) and a manual method on grayscale images, along with visualizations of the original and equalized histograms. The program also applies contrast stretching, logarithmic transformation, and gamma correction to enhance image brightness and details. All results, including the original image, transformed images, and histograms, are displayed side by side to allow users to compare the effects of each technique.

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
